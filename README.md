# Llama Index and RAG Learning Hub

Welcome to our Llama Index and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Learning Hub. This repository is your gateway to mastering these cutting-edge techniques and their practical applications.


## Llama Index: Bridging the Data Gap

Llama Index is a versatile data framework available in Python and TypeScript. It's tailored for LLM-based applications, allowing you to ingest, structure, and access data, especially when dealing with private or domain-specific information. Large Language Models (LLMs), although powerful, lack the ability to handle unique or structured data. Llama Index bridges this gap, augmenting LLMs with your specific data and enabling you to harness the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG enhances the predictive quality of Large Language Models by integrating external data during inference. It builds richer prompts, incorporates context, history, and recent knowledge, leading to more accurate predictions. RAG LLMs outperform non-retrieval models while using fewer parameters. This approach allows for updates to knowledge and provides citations for transparent evaluation. External data sources often include vector databases and feature stores, capitalizing on LLMs' in-context learning capabilities.
